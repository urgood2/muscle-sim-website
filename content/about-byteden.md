Brawn Bastion: The Muscle Community is a 2D ASCII colony builder and simulation game in development, with a vision to create an engaging and immersive experience. Drawing inspiration from intricate simulation games like Dwarf Fortress, this indie project focuses on managing a group of creatures as they build a sustainable colony and defend against potential threats. The game aims to combine procedural generation, simplified interactions, and AI-driven creatures to provide a unique gaming experience. As Brawn Bastion is in its early development stages, players can look forward to the gradual introduction of various tasks and elements, such as resource management, environmental features, and more, in the future updates as the game takes shape.
