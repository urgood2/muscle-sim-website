details: "Sorry about the clutter. The site is a work in progress. You'll find ASCII-themed game prototypes here, made using C++ and raylib. Please note these are *very* prototype-y and sometimes incomplete, and reflect my obsession with ASCII-themed graphics (not very user-friendly, I know).

If you have anything you'd like to talk about, feel free to use the form below!"
