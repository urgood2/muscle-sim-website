Day 14. Added walls. Did a bunch of coding, adding reload at button click, debugging collision, adding juice to player enemy collision, and some gradient rect rendering for loot drops and stuff later. Also thinking I might just do upgrading cards like in balatro instead of stacks, seems less like a hassle, and introduces resource consumption and forces players to lock into a build. But first Iâ€™ll have to make more mechanics to plaay with before I have an idea about the gameplay. UX will also need attention, drag drop for everything is too much of a hassle? But then again, stacklands does fine with it.
