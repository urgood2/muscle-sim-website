### Day 1

So I'll be documenting the creation of a little game from start to finish on here, on a daily post basis, for experimentaion and motivation purposes. This was day 1. I did a lot of ideation and mind-mapping today to lay out the features I had in mind for this game, which fuses elements from games I enjoyed such as Stacklands, Path of Achra, and POE. It's to be a survivors-like in terms of the combat, but will have configurable loadouts and build crafting based on card stacks like you see in Stacklands or Rocket Rats.

The process of brainstorming a design with a mindmap is new to me. While I'm not in the "make a GDD before you make a game" camp, I have experienced that I tend to add what I plan for in the end in my projects, and I wanted to make this feel like a real game instead of a scuffed 1-week prototype. Planning for systems and how they interact feels important, so that's what I did. The planning isn't 100% done yet.
