Day 9. Realized I hadn’t laid out how the stats in the game will interact with the rest of the systems and sat down to try and plan it out. Was promptly overwhelmed by the sheer broadness of the possibilities. Also, how would I make it so the triggers don’t fill up the entire screen? Right now I need quite a few of them, I think, working in tandem. Also had the idea of adding artifacts which will provide bonuses to secondary stats and mix up gameplay in unique ways. So for now, I would need to add a leveling system that increases 1 of a core stat each time, lay it out so more triggers can be used at the same time, and see where that takes me. Also, updating the mind map is becoming a bit of a hassle. Wondering if I should just keep a text file with the planned stats and upgrades.
