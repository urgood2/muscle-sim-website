- Frustrated with the limited time I have (I translate 8-9 webnovel titles daily from Korean to English on a daily basis) to program, I took it upon myself today (Sunday) to complete a game in a day. Well, I failed to do that, mostly because I made the scope a bit too big and I got hung over some UI tweaking (making context menus disappear after mouse moves out of it in IMGUI is hard).
- I've got some basic UI together.
- Notable new things I've done include using font awesome icons, image rendering within the IMGUI context with animations, playing some sound effects and using some new gui elements I haven't tried before such as the collapsing header. 
- I worked a total of maybe 4-5 hours on this, but that wasn't enough for me to get a basic game loop going, unfortunately. Perhaps I'll return to this particular project in the future. 
- At least I know to keep the games I want to make in short burts even shorter than I think is proper.
