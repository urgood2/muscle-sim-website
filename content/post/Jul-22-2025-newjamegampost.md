So I did another game jam. This time it was a colony sim (or had aspirations to be) about fighting global damage through roguelike relics & three different classes of characters. I like how the result turned out, but as usual, a week is probably too short to strike a good balance for gameplay, especially when you get random relics involved.

What I really like about my process so far is the use of lua for nonexistant build times (except when I modify my c++ codebase). What I don't like is a mysterious lua binding error that only happens some of the time and nearly wrecked my submission at the end.
