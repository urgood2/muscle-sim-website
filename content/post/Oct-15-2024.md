- Tweaked waitForEvent() in lua to deliver payload. Need to run unit tests on event system again 
- Made sol2 error message more detailed, 
- Got event waiting payloads working 
- Segfault with unit test, trying to solve. 
- Event unit test works, all tests pass, but the test still says it fails, and sometimes it throws a segfault for no predictable reason (not always) 
- Updated input system to pass payloads with relevant data. 
- Added input system unit test, needs debugging 
- Need more work on input system.hpp and .cpp, and then unit testing all over again
