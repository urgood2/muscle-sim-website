Learned about post/pre-solve as I integrate chipmunk physics into my codebase. Most of the steps are already done, thiugh the code is getting pretty bloated, and recompiling takes several minutes even on a mac. It was a great choice to go with lua in addition to this c++ codebase; it really helps with iteration speeds and simplifying things in my head so I can focus more on the gameplay as opposed to boilerplate and code structure.
