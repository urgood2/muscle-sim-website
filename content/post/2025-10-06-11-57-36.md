Game jams are usually the way I’ve found most success completing projects. I don’t think I’m 100% comfortable with exploring ideas at my own pace without external deadlines, at least not yet. One could argue that perhaps the distinction is vague at best, though, in which case I would rather like to have a way to explore my own paths without it being too overwhelming. One thing I can think of is self-imposed blocks of time, like hosting my own jams. The gap between excited ideation and actual playable game hasn’t closed enough times for me yet for it to be second nature. Ideally I would find the most fun and immersion in the process itself, exploring the possibilities in the mechanics, etc.
