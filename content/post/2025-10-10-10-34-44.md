My current schedule is, 
1. Do some translation work in the early morning
2. Head to the public library at around 9:30 and do some more
3. Develop my game for a bit (2-3 hours) before a late lunch
4. Gym, then do more translation work. 
5. After that comes dinner and family time.
I guess it really doesn’t leave much dev time. I’ll have to see how I can optimize, and how much I will actually need. For now I really like coming to the library.
