A recent video from IndieGameClinic describes that game design is not a set of rules to memorize, but a soft skill that isn’t as easy to quantify. My takeaway was that it’s something you do by playing games, and designing games yourself. Makes a lot of sense, though it doesn’t make game making any easier of course.
