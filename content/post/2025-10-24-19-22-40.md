Days 17 and 18. Work is starting to increase a bit again. Itâ€™s kind of a struggle, balancing game dev and work, but not because of motivation (though maybe it kinda is?). Not having large enough batches of time to spend on the game can be painful. I feel I need those to make progress. Redid the ui, added an eval system a la noita, and did collisions so enemies hurt you and you can pick up exp pickups, player can also dash now.
