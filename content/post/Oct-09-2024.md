- Added goap world state atom access function 
- Added zoom camera to entity/location functionality 
- Added a method to display indicator arrows around an entity, which needs testing 
- Pretty happy to see this working as planned:

```lua {linenos=table,linenostart=0}
function tutorials.sample(deltaTime)
    addGameAnnouncement("[color:KONSOLE_BREEZE_NEON_GREEN]Welcome to the tutorial![/color]") -- TODO: should be showwindow method instead
    addGameAnnouncement("Wait for 3 seconds...")
    
    wait(3) -- Wait for 3 seconds
    
    addGameAnnouncement("Now press the [color:KONSOLE_BREEZE_WARM_BROWN_ORANGE]'A'[/color] key.")
    waitForKeyPress("KEY_A") -- Wait for the 'A' key press
    debug("'A' key pressed!")

    
    -- show a color coded message in a window and wait for a tutorial window closed event
    -- If the window contained multiple buttons, there will be a table payload to indicate which button was pressed
    showTutorialWindow("You have [color:KONSOLE_BREEZE_TEAL_GREEN]completed[/color] the tutorial!")
    
    pauseGame() -- Pause the game before locking the controls
    lockControls() -- Lock the controls except gui
    waitForEvent("tutorial_window_closed") -- Wait for a specific in-game event
    unlockControls() -- Unlock the controls
    unpauseGame() -- Unpause the game

    addGameAnnouncement("Screen fade test.")
    fadeOutScreen(10) -- Fade out the screen in 1 second
    wait(10) 
    fadeInScreen(1) -- Fade in the screen in 1 second
    
    addGameAnnouncement("[color:KONSOLE_BREEZE_NEON_GREEN]Tutorial completed![/color]")
    
end
```
